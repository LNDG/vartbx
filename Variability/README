Variability Toolbox for SPM
Version 0.1

This toolbox measures voxel-based temporal variability in fMRI data, and will output Nifti files. The toolbox structure is intended to be similar to a standard SPM first-level analysis. You can then proceed with those level-1 variability-based images to a level-2 analysis in order to model effects of interest. However, the nii output files could also be used within other statistics programs of your choice (e.g., FSL, AFNI, PLS).

The toolbox currently supports modeling block designs with a boxcar model, and computes variability using measures such as: detrended standard deviation (SD), variance (VAR), mean squared successive difference (MSSD) and SQRT(MSSD). We plan to add additional modeling approaches and variability measures in future releases.

To use the toolbox, you would specify your model in the first-level analysis as usual. You then save the model, which is used as input for the toolbox to specify all sessions, conditions, onsets, durations, and nuisance regressors.
